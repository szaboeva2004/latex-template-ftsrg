\chapter{The transformation from BTOR2 to (X)CFAs \todo{Or just simply Implementation?}}

\section{Overview}

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

The goal of this project is to provide a direct BTOR2 frontend for the Theta model checker, translating BTOR2 models into Theta's XCFA representation. While the existing tool Btor2C translates BTOR2 into C for use with software verifiers, this detour might introduce unnecessary complexity and limits optimization opportunities.[4] A native frontend will hopefully enable a more efficient, faster, and easier-to-optimize verification flow by eliminating intermediate representations.
