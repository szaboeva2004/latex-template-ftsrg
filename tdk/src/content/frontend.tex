\section{Theta}\label{sec:theta}

Regarding the implementation, I chose Theta~\cite{theta}, a modular and extensible model checking framework developed by the Critical Systems Research Group at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, as the target platform for integrating a BTOR2 frontend.

The main advantage of Theta is its support for the combination of various abstract domains, interpreters, and strategies for abstraction and refinement, applied to models of various formalisms with higher level language front-ends (e.g. for C programs, or in my case BTOR2 circuits).

To begin, I defined an unofficial BTOR2 grammar using ANTLR4~\cite{antlr}, a powerful parser generator widely adopted in both academia and industry for constructing interpreters, compilers, and domain-specific languages.

Theta supports abstraction-refinement based reachability analysis. In my project, I worked with XCFA modelsâ€”an extension of Control Flow Automata (CFA) that incorporates procedures and concurrency - but focused primarily on the CFA subset. This allowed me to apply Theta's robust CEGAR-based algorithms for reachability checking.
