            The content generated by generative AI had a minor impact on the substantive part of the thesis tasks; it was used primarily as an editor and for generating Python visualization scripts. The core implementation of the \textsc{BTOR2CFA} tool, the experimental setup, the selection of benchmarks, the raw data collection, and the interpretation of results were performed entirely by me. The AI assisted in writing the code to plot the visual data, but the scientific findings and analysis remain the result of my work.
            
            Based on the above, the estimated total proportion of content generated by generative AI in relation to the substantive part of the task is 10\%.
