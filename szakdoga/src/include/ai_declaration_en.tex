\noindent $\boxtimes$ \textbf{I have used generative AI tools.} I have verified the content generated by AI, ensured the accuracy of the outputs, and properly indicated each instance of use in the table below.

            The content generated by generative AI had a minor impact on the substantive part of the thesis tasks; it was used primarily as an editor and analytical assistant. The core implementation of the \textsc{BTOR2CFA} tool, the experimental setup, the selection of benchmarks, and the raw data collection were performed entirely by me. The AI assisted in polishing the thesis content and interpreting the visual data trends, but the scientific findings remain the result of my work.
            
            Based on the above, the estimated total proportion of content generated by generative AI in relation to the substantive part of the task is 15\%.
