abstract="We describe Btor2, a word-level model checking format for capturing models of hardware and potentially software in a bit-precise manner. This simple, line-based and easy to parse format can be seen as a sorted extension of the word-level format Btor. It uses design principles from the bit-level format Aiger and follows semantics of the Smt-Lib logics of bit-vectors with arrays. This intermediate format can be used in various verification flows and is perfectly suited to establish a word-level model checking competition. It is supported by our new open source model checker BtorMC, which is built on top of version 3.0 of our SMT solver Boolector. We further provide new word-level benchmarks on which these open source tools are evaluated.",

abstract="Abstraction, counterexample-guided refinement, and interpolation are techniques that are essential to the success of predicate-based program analysis. These techniques have not yet been applied together to explicit-value program analysis. We present an approach that integrates abstraction and interpolationbased refinement into an explicit-value analysis, i.e., a program analysis that tracks explicit values for a specified set of variables (the precision). The algorithm uses an abstract reachability graph as central data structure and a path-sensitive dynamic approach for precision adjustment. We evaluate our algorithm on the benchmark set of the Competition on Software Verification 2012 (SV-COMP'12) to show that our new approach is highly competitive. We also show that combining our new approach with an auxiliary predicate analysis scores significantly higher than the SV-COMP'12 winner.",

abstract="Model checking provides an automated method for verifying concurrent systems. Correctness specifications are given in temporal logic. The method hinges on an efficient and flexible graph-theoretic reachability algorithm. At the time of its introduction in the early 1980's, the prevailing paradigm for verification was a manual one of proof-theoretic reasoning using formal axioms and inference rules oriented towards sequential programs. The need to encompass concurrent programs, the desire to avoid the difficulties with manual deductive proofs, and the small model theorem for temporal logic motivated the development of model checking.",

abstract="Model checking is an automatic verification technique for hardware and software systems that are finite state or have finite state abstractions. It has been used successfully to verify computer hardware, and it is beginning to be used to verify computer software as well. As the number of state variables in the system increases, the size of the system state space grows exponentially. This is called the ``state explosion problem''. Much of the research in model checking over the past 30 years has involved developing techniques for dealing with this problem. In these lecture notes, we will explain how the basic model checking algorithms work and describe some recent approaches to the state explosion problem, with an emphasis on Bounded Model Checking.",

ABSTRACT = {Digital systems are nowadays ubiquitous and often comprise an extremely high level of complexity. Guaranteeing the correct behavior of such systems has become an ever more pressing need for manufacturers. The correctness of digital systems can be addressed resorting to formal verification techniques, such as model checking. Currently, it is usually impossible to determine a priori the best algorithm to use given a verification task and, thus, portfolio approaches have become the de facto standard in model checking verification suites. This paper describes the most relevant algorithms and techniques, at the foundations of bit-level SAT-based model checking itself.},

AVR provides independently-verifiable certificates that offer provable assurance and are easy to relate to the word-level system. Moreover, proof certificates can be further used in innovative ways to extract key design information and are useful in a growing number of applications.",

abstract="Configurable software verification is a recent concept for expressing different program analysis and model checking approaches in one single formalism. This paper presents CPAchecker, a tool and framework that aims at easy integration of new verification components. Every abstract domain, together with the corresponding operations, implements the interface of configurable program analysis (CPA). The main algorithm is configurable to perform a reachability analysis on arbitrary combinations of existing CPAs. In software verification, it takes a considerable amount of effort to convert a verification idea into actual experimental results --- we aim at accelerating this process. We hope that researchers find it convenient and productive to implement new verification ideas and algorithms using this flexible and easy-to-extend platform, and that it advances the field by making it easier to perform practical experiments. The tool is implemented in Java and runs as command-line tool or as eclipse plug-in. CPAchecker implements CPAs for several abstract domains. We evaluate the efficiency of the current version of our tool on software-verification benchmarks from the literature, and compare it with other state-of-the-art model checkers. CPAchecker is an open-source toolkit and publicly available.",
